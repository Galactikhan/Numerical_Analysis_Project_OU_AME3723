## How to Run)
   In order to run this code; save the files BisecAllRoots.m, BisectionRoot.m, and fun.m into the directory your working in. Next input the desired a & b points as well as the Maximum Tolerance. The Project's descriptions makes the run command:
      
 R = BisecAllRoots(@fun, -3, 6, 0.0001)
